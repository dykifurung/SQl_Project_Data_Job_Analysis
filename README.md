# Introduction

This project provides an analysis of the data job market, with a particular focus on data analyst roles. It examines key factors such as top-paying positions, essential skills, and the relationship between job demand and salary trends in the field of data analytics.

The SQL queries used in this analysis are available here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/) 

# Background

This job market analysis is based on a course led by respected Data Analyst Luke Barrouse. The capstone project, presented here, explores the data analyst job market using the tools and techniques covered in the course. The raw data used for this analysis can be accessed through the following link: [SQL Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql).

###  The objective of my SQL queries was to address the following questions:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used

The tools I used to be able to analyze the data analyst job market are the following:
- **SQL**: For querying the database effectively to generate valuable insights
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the database management system
- **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**: Executed SQL queries and handled database management
- **Git and GitHub**: Facilitated project tracking to enable version control and sharing of SQL scripts and observations

# Analysis

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To determine the most well-compensated roles, I analyzed data analyst positions based on average annual salary and location, prioritizing remote opportunities. 

``` sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS job_postings
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY    
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
Insights from the top 10 data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Industry Influence**: The tech, finance, and healthcare sectors offer the highest salaries, as they rely on big data, AI, and predictive analytics. Companies like Meta, SmartAsset, and UCLA Health demonstrate strong demand for data expertise.
- **Wide Salary Range**: Compensation varies from $184,000 to an outlier of $650,000, influenced by role complexity, specialization, and company size. Leadership and high-impact roles (e.g., Director of Analytics at Meta - $336,500) offer significantly higher pay.
- **Leadership and Experience**: Senior positions consistently command top salaries, emphasizing the value of decision-making, management, and strategic insights. However, specialists in AI, cloud computing, and business intelligence can still earn six figures without moving into leadership.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs

To identify the skills needed for top-paying jobs, I combined job postings with skills data, revealing key insights into what employers prioritize for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS job_postings
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY    
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
```
